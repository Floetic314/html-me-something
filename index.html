            <p>Im from ST. LOUIS. One of the best cities in the world. 
            I was born and raised here, but left briefly in order to pursue a bachelor's degree in Alabama.
             After working for a few years after graduation, I managed to find my way back home.</p>

 <h1>My City</h1>
    <p>
        St. Louis is a city that you hate to love. There are so many things that I dont like about the city, but there is so much that I love. St. Louis is an EXTREMELY segregated city. That is one of the things I hate most. However, when you are lucky, you get to actually meet some cool people that live here. A map of the neighborhoods is shown below.
