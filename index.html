            <p>I was born and raised here, but left briefly in order to pursue a bachelor's degree in Alabama.
             After working for a few years after graduation, I managed to find my way back home.
            A few things that you need to know about me:

        St. Louis is a city that you hate to love. There are so many things that I dont like about the city, but there is so much that I love. St. Louis is an EXTREMELY segregated city. That is one of the things I hate most. However, when you are lucky, you get to actually meet some cool people that live here. A map of the neighborhoods is shown below.
        Click <a href="https://www.stlmag.com/news/the-color-line-race-in-st.-louis/"> here </a>to read an article that talks about the history of segregation in STL.
